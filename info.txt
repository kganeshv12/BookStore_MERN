we use nodemon for restarting server automatically
we use express as the web framework


Some key features of Express.js include:

Middleware: Express.js is built around the concept of middleware, which are functions that 
have access to the request and response objects and can modify them or terminate the request
-response cycle. Middleware functions can be used for tasks such as logging, authentication, 
error handling, and more.

Routing: Express provides a simple and intuitive API for defining routes based on HTTP methods 
(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL patterns. Routes can be organized into modular routers 
to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.

app.get() helps get a resouce frmo server.


By using 
app.use('/books', bookRoutes)
, the application is essentially "mounting" the 
bookRoutes
 middleware at the 
/books
 endpoint. This means that any requests to URLs starting with 
/books
 will be handled by the 
bookRoutes
 middleware.

This is a common pattern in Express.js applications, 
as it helps to organize the codebase 
and keep the routing logic separate from the main application logic.


CORS POLICY :

cross origin resource sharing

it is a security mechanism in the browser that restricts the ability of the web page
to make requests to a different domain.

it is a web security mechanism that prevents unauthorized cross-origin access to a resource or a cell.
