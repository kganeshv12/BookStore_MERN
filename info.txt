we use nodemon for restarting server automatically
we use express as the web framework


Some key features of Express.js include:

Middleware: Express.js is built around the concept of middleware, which are functions that 
have access to the request and response objects and can modify them or terminate the request
-response cycle. Middleware functions can be used for tasks such as logging, authentication, 
error handling, and more.

Routing: Express provides a simple and intuitive API for defining routes based on HTTP methods 
(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL patterns. Routes can be organized into modular routers 
to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.

app.get() helps get a resouce frmo server.
